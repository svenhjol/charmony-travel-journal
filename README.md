# Travel Journal
Adds a personal **travel journal** to make bookmarks for interesting places around the world.
It is designed to be lightweight and plays nicely with vanilla servers such as Realms.
The travel journal can be accessed any time by pressing the `J` key (by default).
The bookmark and journal keys can be changed via the Minecraft keybindings settings page.

## Making a bookmark
There are two ways to make a bookmark at your current location:
1. Press the `B` key to take a photo at your current location. A 3-second countdown lets you position yourself correctly!
2. Press the `J` key to open the journal. Click "New bookmark" to take the photo as above.

Once the photo is taken you can modify the name and description of the bookmark, then save it to your journal or delete it.

## Accessing bookmarks
Press the `J` key to open the journal. Click the arrows left and right to find the bookmark you saved, then click the Details button
to find out more about it or delete it.

## Sharing bookmarks with nearby players
> Note that this only works if the `charmony-travel-journal` mod is also installed on the server!

Press the `J` key to open the journal and find the bookmark you want to share.
Click the Details button to open the specific bookmark.
On the top right of the bookmark page, you will see a small button with a picture of Steve's face.
If a player is nearby the button can be clicked and you can select the name of the player you want to share the bookmark with.

## Configuration
The **travel journal** mod lets you change the width and height of the photo that will be taken for the bookmark.
You can also stop anyone sharing bookmarks with you or you can choose the players that are allowed to send you bookmarks.
Open the `charmony-travel-journal-client.toml` config file to change settings or use the in-game charmony settings button.
